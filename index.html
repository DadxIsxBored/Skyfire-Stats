<h1>This data is collected from Overstat, sorted using personally created apps on my own PC and the math can be found and explained via DM on twitter or discord. All weights are determined by a survey conducted by me to the larger apex legends competitive community on the perceived importance of each stat. This table is only to show collective stats for analytics purposes, it is in no way my opinion, nor is it a list of who is and is not a better player. It is simply a statistical chart showing who has performed better, statistically. The Weighted overall Contribution Grade is simply a percentage based grading system that separates 10% SS, 5% S, 5% AA, 5% A, 10% BB, 15% B, 15% CC, 10% C, 5% DD, 5% D, 5% FF, and 10% F, and is for sorting and ease of read purposes. Furthermore, I do not intend this table to be, in any form, a definitive statement on who is and is not good or bad at the game. If at any point you see inconsistency or error in the data PLEASE reach out to me and I will fix it post haste, this includes, incorrect numbers, names, double names, changed names' stats not being combined with one another, ETC. Please enjoy and remember; this is the internet, nothing here is that serious.</h1>
